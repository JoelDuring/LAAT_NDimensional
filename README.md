# LAAT
This repository contains additional figures and synthetic datasets that were introduced in "LAAT: Locally Aligned Ant Technique for detecting manifolds of varying density". We will release the code publicly after the paper gets accepted. If you have any question please feel free to ask through my email address (abolfazl.taghribi@gmail.com)
